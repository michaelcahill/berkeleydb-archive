To install this php module linked against the mod_db4 framework,
execute the following steps:

> phpize
> ./configure --with-db4[=/path/to/db4]
--with-mod_db4=$APACHE_INCLUDEDIR
> make
> su -
# make install

Then in your php.ini file add:

extension=db4.so

This extension will now only run in a SAPI linked into Apache httpd
(mod_php4, 
most likely), and will take advantage of all of it's auto-recovery and
handle-caching facilities.


To install this php module linked against db-4.2 and NOT the mod_db4
framework,
execute the following steps:

> phpize
> ./configure --with-db4[=/path/to/db4]
> make
> su -
# make install

Then in your php.ini file add:

extension=db4.so
